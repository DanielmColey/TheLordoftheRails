				Daily Smarty
			</h2>
			<p>
				This website clone is done in a blog format. Daily Smarty is a place where people can come to be informed on many topics from politics, sports, and even gaming. This was a fun project because it helped me understand a completely different style of formatting using HTML/CSS.

				Tesla Clone
			</h2>
			<p>
				This app was a school project where we created a website using Ruby and Rails that could allow salaried employees to track their overtime. The app doesn't just store the data but also allows Administrator access to approve or deny the overtime on a page that denies access to employees. Employees are notified through SMS to record their hours. This project was highly test driven using rspec. Username: test@test.com or admin@test.com Password: asdfasdf

				Ruby Challenges
			</h2>
			<p>
				Everyday I am faced with a prompt and have the opportunity to stretch my knowledge of ruby concepts. These are challenges from altering given data to creating a program from the ground up. These challenges are important to me because if forces me to think outside the box and invent new ways to solve issues.

				Google Clone
			</h2>
			<p>
				This was the first website I w=ever cloned before. I was intimidated to take it on but it was an extremely pleasent suprise when I was able to turn out a very close replica. This was actually what grew my love for HTML/CSS.
